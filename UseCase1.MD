Migrating a local Java-based frontend application to Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) requires careful planning. I'll provide a detailed guide based on the AWS Well-Architected Framework, focusing on the operational excellence, security, reliability, performance efficiency, and cost optimization pillars.

1. Operational Excellence:
1.1. Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Use AWS CloudFormation or Terraform to set up and manage your EKS clusters. This helps in easy replication and ensures consistent deployments.

1.2. Monitoring and Logging: Integrate CloudWatch and CloudTrail for monitoring and logging. You can also use EKS-native tools like Prometheus and Grafana.

1.3. CI/CD Integration: Integrate your EKS with your CI/CD tools to automate deployment. Jenkins, CircleCI, and AWS CodePipeline are good options.
